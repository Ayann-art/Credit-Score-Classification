## 📊 Credit Score Classification – Data Cleaning & Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a credit score classification dataset obtained from Kaggle.
The main purpose of the project is to prepare a high-quality dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to better understand the factors that influence an individual's credit score.

All data cleaning and analysis processes were performed using Python in Google Colab.

## 📁 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Credit Score Classification Dataset
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/parisrohan/credit-score-classification

File used: train.csv

Note: The dataset is not included in this repository.
Please download it directly from Kaggle using the link above.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Google Colab

Pandas

NumPy

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

Removed duplicate records

Handled missing values

Converted columns to appropriate data types

Fixed inconsistent and invalid values

Cleaned numerical columns containing symbols or text

Renamed columns for better readability

Standardized categorical variables

A cleaned version of the dataset was created after these steps.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Basic analysis was performed to understand relationships between variables and credit score categories, including:

Distribution of credit score classes

Relationship between income and credit score

Effect of outstanding debt on credit score

Analysis of age groups and credit behavior

## 🔍 Key Insights

Higher income levels are generally associated with better credit scores

Customers with high outstanding debt tend to have lower credit scores

Fewer delayed payments are linked to better credit score categories
